<p>I, Strahd Von Zarovich the first of his name, am the Ancient. I, Strahd Von Zarovich the first of his name, am the Land. My beginnings are ages far and away in the darkness of the past. I was the warrior, I was good and just. I thundered across the land like the wrath of the gods along whom I fought, but the war years and the killing years wore down my soul as the wind wears stone into sand.</p>
<p>My armies were settled with the darkest forces of the land defeated, yet all things good continued to slip from my life. I found my youth gone, and my strength along with it. We settled ourselves in the valley my father had renamed for himself, having taken our power over the people in the name of defense against dark forces.  We laid our home in the place my father had built in afterness of my mother, a place that was taken from me for a time but was destined to become my home.  A castle, my castle. Ravenloft.</p>
<p>And yet I was never destined to rest easy. My brothers took from me what was mine, and I in turn acted to keep it. They never  respected the Zarovich name, and I claimed myself from them, made myself better. </p>
<p>Would that my sacrifice had paid itself back in the reward I was so promised.</p>
